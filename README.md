**Project 2: Pharmacy Delivery Routing**

* CLI application for a "distribution company" that calculates the best routes for delivery trucks that need to go to certain pharmacies to deliver goods;
* Each pharmacy needs a different product quantity and also has a set schedule in which it is available to receive the deliveries. For these deliveries, the company has delivery trucks (a finite amount), and each truck has a specific capacity. Each truck leaves the company HQ to deliver the products to a set of pharmacies, and then returns to the central. Furthermore, the locations of the pharmacies and the central are known, as well as the distance/time between each pair of locations;
* The problem is an instance of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRP-TW); the goal is to generate the schedule of the distribution company, while minimizing both the number of trucks used and the overall distance traveled by the trucks.
* Languages/technologies used: **Prolog (and its clpfd restrictions library).**

**Grade**: 19.7 / 20
